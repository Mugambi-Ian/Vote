# Vote
This app serves as a terminal to voters via secret ballot. This app greatly improves the efficiency of the election process by making it mobile while still maintaining its integrity. I would like to note that this version was specifically built for my school.

## Getting Started
This project only contains information related to the voting terminal. To access information on the Election Board terminal click [here](https://github.com/nenecorporates/Election-Board).
1. On opening the app, it checks for permission to use your camera and access telephony services. Telephony services are used in device verification using its IMEI while the camera is used to scan the barcode on the back of one's school id for human verification.

5. If the user email is valid the user is then required to scan the barcode on the back of their id for human verification.

6. If this is the user's first election the user will be required to set up a voters passkey. This key can only be changed from the election office.

7. The user will then be presented with election candidates for each position on a slide. Swiping right or left switches between candidates. Clicking on the tick button is voting for the candidate. On voting for the first position, the user is automatically taken to the next position until all positions are voted for.
